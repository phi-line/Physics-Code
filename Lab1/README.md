# Data
On the X-axis we have the Time in seconds fitted to the respective dataset

On the Y-axis we have the Probability where a data point lies in a bin

We plotted our data with 10 bins. Although, this graphical representation would change with the number of bins. This is a common issue with histograms, since the number of bins can skew the results in a particular direction. It is usually best to pick a common factor for the number of bins based on the total number of entries. Since there was a drastically different number of entries per Lab Group, we chose 10 for consistency with the data.
